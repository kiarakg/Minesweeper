# Minesweeper
This is a Python implementation of 2-D Minesweeper!
* You start the game by running the script in terminal or console.
* In order to "dig" at a certain location, you type in the index of the row, then the column, separated by a comma and space. the game "digs" recursively around that location if there are no bombs nearby.
* You can continue digging until either you hit a bomb (which is game over) or you've successfully dug up all non-bomb locations (which is victory!)
